# "System Verilog for Verification" by Chris Spear and Greg Tumbush

In preparation for my job as a verification engineer I worked my way 
through a portion of "System Verilog for Verification" by Chis Spear 
and Greg Tumbush. This repository contains notes (which may be cryptic,
unclear, or completely wrong FYI ðŸ™ƒ), example problems I completed, etc.

As I work on this I'll add build steps for whatever verification tool 
I end up using.
