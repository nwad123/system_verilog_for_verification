# "System Verilog for Verification" by Chris Spear and Greg Tumbush

In preparation for my job as a verification engineer I worked my way 
through a portion of "System Verilog for Verification" by Chis Spear 
and Greg Tumbush. This repository contains notes (which may be cryptic,
unclear, or completely wrong FYI ðŸ™ƒ), example problems I completed, etc.

As I work on this I'll add build steps for whatever verification tool 
I end up using.

## Note on my Notes

I don't really use headings or sub-headings in my notes, because after
I write my notes I use [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
in my editor to search through them for keywords or examples. This means
that my notes are not exactly "readable" by just skimming through the
markdown files. If you're someone who is not me trying to access my 
notes, I'd recommend using [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) 
or a similar tool to browse them.
